    <!--
         This sample shows how to add multiple layers to your application.
         The sample consists of three layers, a basemap, demographic data,
         and finally a reference layer with boundaries and place names.

         The World Terrain Base service, a cached map service from ArcGIS
         Online is added first. This service was designed to be used as a
         basemap with additional layers, such as demographic data, displayed
         on top.

         Next, custom data is added to the map. This can be reference data
         from ArcGIS Online or your own published map service. When adding
         this layer to the map the alpha (transparency) is set to 0.5 so
         that the basemap is visible underneath the demographic data.
